      <h1>Beyond detection. Beyond removal.</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Toward lasting change.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Social media has created an environment where harmful behaviors spread and reinforce themselves. Beyond Hate explores how behavioral science research can counter this&mdash;starting with two challenging problems: online hate speech and vaccine hesitancy.</p>

        <p>The central question: <em>Can we move beyond detection and removal toward interventions that create lasting behavior change?</em></p>

        <p>The answer lies not in better AI, but in designing systems that account for why people actually change&mdash;through trusted networks, multiple touchpoints, and community visibility.</p>

        <h2>The core insight</h2>

        <p>Diseases and ideas spread through single contact&mdash;one exposure is enough. But behavior change doesn't work that way. Research on social contagion shows that changing how people think and act requires <strong>multiple reinforcing exposures from trusted sources</strong>&mdash;not one-time interventions.</p>

        <p>What actually works involves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple touchpoints</strong> across different contexts</li>
          <li><strong>Trusted messengers</strong>&mdash;nurses, peers, community members</li>
          <li><strong>Visible community data</strong>&mdash;showing what others in your network are doing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>AI can be a component&mdash;but only one component in a larger system designed around how behavior actually changes.</p>

        <h2>A framework that integrates the research</h2>

        <p>This approach draws on seven complementary lines of research:</p>

        <p>These aren't just abstract theories. They inform concrete design decisions: which intervention to use when, which messenger to deploy, how to sequence touchpoints, how to make community progress visible.</p>

        <h2>Why this matters</h2>

        <p>We're at an inflection point. AI makes new kinds of interventions possible&mdash;but we need to think carefully about what actually creates change.</p>

        <p>The easy path is building more chatbots, more detection systems, more content moderation. The harder path is designing systems that account for trust, networks, multiple touchpoints, and the messy reality of how humans change their minds.</p>
