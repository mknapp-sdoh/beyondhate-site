      <p class="subtitle">Positive behavior change through social networks</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Social media has created an environment where harmful behaviors spread and reinforce themselves. The typical response&mdash;flag it, remove it, ban the account&mdash;doesn't change behavior. Beyond Hate explores what does.</p>

        <h2>The core insight</h2>

        <p>Diseases and ideas spread through single contact&mdash;one exposure is enough. But behavior change doesn't work that way. Research on social contagion shows that changing how people act requires <strong>multiple reinforcing exposures from trusted sources</strong>&mdash;not one-time interventions.</p>

        <p>What works:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple touchpoints</strong>&mdash;People need to hear the message more than once, in different situations. A parent might hear about vaccines from their doctor, then from a neighbor, then at school pickup.</li>
          <li><strong>Trusted messengers</strong>&mdash;The message needs to come from people you already trust. A peer calling out a hateful message has impact. A nurse you know is more persuasive than an anonymous public health campaign.</li>
          <li><strong>Visible community data</strong>&mdash;People are more likely to act when they see others like them already doing it. Local vaccination rates matter. So does seeing neighbors apologize or change course.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A framework that integrates the research</h2>

        <p>This approach draws on seven complementary lines of research:</p>
