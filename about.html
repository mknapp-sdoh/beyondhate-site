    <h2>This work</h2>

    <p>Beyond Hate explores how behavioral science research might inform approaches to two challenging problems: online hate speech and vaccine hesitancy.</p>

    <p>The central question: <em>Can we move beyond detection and removal toward interventions that create lasting behavior change?</em></p>

    <p>The answer, it turns out, isn't about better AI. It's about designing systems that account for how people actually change&mdash;through trusted networks, multiple touchpoints, and community visibility.</p>

    <p>This site documents an ongoing exploration. The <a href="/framework/">framework</a> synthesizes relevant research. The <a href="/applications/hate-response.html">applications</a> show how these ideas might apply to specific challenges. None of this is finished; it's thinking in progress.</p>

    <h2>Michael Knapp</h2>

    <p>Michael Knapp builds technology for mission-driven organizations. He has spent the past year exploring how AI can create value for nonprofits and social enterprises&mdash;and learning that the most valuable outcomes are often the ones you didn't plan for.</p>

    <p>This work on hate speech and vaccine hesitancy grew from a broader interest in how technology can support behavior change at scale, particularly in domains where trust has eroded and information alone isn't enough.</p>

    <p>Michael is founder of <a href="https://sdoh.org">sdoh.org</a> and author of <a href="https://seedwork.ai">Seedwork</a>, a methodology for building with LLMs.</p>
