      <h1>About</h1>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Michael Knapp, PhD, builds technology for mission-driven organizations. He has spent the past two years exploring how AI can create value for nonprofits and social enterprises&mdash;and learning that the most valuable outcomes are often the ones you didn't plan for.</p>

        <p>This work on hate speech and vaccine hesitancy grew from a broader interest in how emerging technology can support behavior change at scale, in domains where information alone isn't enough.</p>

        <p>Michael is founder of <a href="https://sdoh.org">sdoh.org</a> and author of <a href="https://seedwork.ai">Seedwork</a>, a methodology for building with LLMs.</p>
