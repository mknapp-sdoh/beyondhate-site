    <h1>Responding to Online Hate</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Beyond detection. Beyond removal. Toward restoration.</p>

    <p>Most platforms approach online hate the same way: detect it, flag it, remove it. The focus is on protecting users from exposure to harmful content.</p>

    <p>But what if we could do more? What if instead of just removing content, we could create the conditions for people to change?</p>

    <h2>The vision</h2>

    <p>Imagine a system that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Detects</strong> harmful content in real-time using NLP</li>
      <li><strong>Responds</strong> with contextually appropriate interventions&mdash;not just removal, but counterspeech, reflective questions, peer engagement</li>
      <li><strong>Amplifies</strong> constructive responses through a curated "Peace Feed"</li>
      <li><strong>Learns</strong> which interventions work through continuous feedback</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn't just content moderation&mdash;it's behavior change at scale.</p>

    <h2>Why Bluesky?</h2>

    <p>Bluesky's decentralized architecture (the AT Protocol) makes new approaches possible:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Custom feeds</strong> can curate content algorithmically&mdash;imagine a "Peace Feed" that surfaces restorative interactions</li>
      <li><strong>Decentralized identity</strong> means interventions can follow users across the network</li>
      <li><strong>Open protocol</strong> allows experimentation without platform gatekeeping</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Centralized platforms optimize for engagement. Decentralized networks let us optimize for different values.</p>

    <h2>Intervention types</h2>

    <p>Different situations call for different responses. Drawing on the <a href="/framework/">framework</a>, potential interventions include:</p>

    <h3>Counterspeech</h3>
    <p>Responding to hate with speech, not censorship. Research by Susan Benesch and others shows counterspeech can be effective&mdash;especially when it comes from in-group members, uses humor or empathy, and provides alternative narratives.</p>

    <h3>Reflective questions</h3>
    <p>Prompts that encourage self-reflection without attacking: "What made you feel that way?" "How do you think they might respond?" Drawing on restorative practices and motivational interviewing.</p>

    <h3>Peer visibility</h3>
    <p>Making constructive responses visible and socially rewarded. When people see their peers engaging positively, complex contagion suggests they're more likely to do the same.</p>

    <h3>Virtual restorative circles</h3>
    <p>Facilitated dialogue between affected parties. Not always possible online, but structured formats can create space for accountability and repair.</p>

    <h3>Behavioral nudges</h3>
    <p>Small friction points before posting (e.g., "Are you sure you want to share this?") and positive reinforcement for constructive engagement.</p>

    <h2>The feedback loop</h2>

    <p>What makes this approach different from static interventions is continuous learning:</p>

    <div class="flow">
      <span class="flow-step">Detect</span>
      <span class="flow-arrow">&rarr;</span>
      <span class="flow-step">Intervene</span>
      <span class="flow-arrow">&rarr;</span>
      <span class="flow-step">Measure</span>
      <span class="flow-arrow">&rarr;</span>
      <span class="flow-step">Learn</span>
      <span class="flow-arrow">&rarr;</span>
      <span class="flow-step">Improve</span>
    </div>

    <p>By tracking engagement metrics, sentiment shifts, and long-term behavior changes, the system can learn which interventions work for which contexts&mdash;and get better over time.</p>

    <h2>What already exists</h2>

    <p>This builds on significant prior work:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Detection:</strong> Perspective API, HateXplain, fine-tuned transformer models</li>
      <li><strong>Counterspeech:</strong> Dangerous Speech Project research on effective responses</li>
      <li><strong>Platform tools:</strong> Content warnings, friction interventions, algorithmic demotion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What's novel is integrating these into a system optimized for behavior change rather than just content removal&mdash;and doing so on a decentralized network where new approaches are possible.</p>

    <h2>The hard problems</h2>

    <p>This approach raises real challenges:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Can restorative approaches work at internet scale?</li>
      <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> How do you prevent bad actors from exploiting the system?</li>
      <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> How do you know if behavior actually changed, or just moved elsewhere?</li>
      <li><strong>Power:</strong> Who decides what counts as "hate" and what interventions are appropriate?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These aren't solved problems. They're open questions that any serious effort has to grapple with.</p>

    <h2>Current status</h2>

    <p>This is conceptual work&mdash;a framework and design document exploring what's possible. It draws on a research synthesis I developed to understand the landscape of hate detection, intervention research, and decentralized social networks.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="/papers/hate-response-system.pdf">Download the full design document (PDF) &rarr;</a></strong></p>

    <p>The next step would be prototyping specific components: a custom Bluesky feed, a set of intervention responses, and measurement infrastructure to test what actually works.</p>
