    <h1>Addressing Vaccine Hesitancy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Beyond the chatbot. Toward trusted networks.</p>

    <p>Measles cases are rising. Vaccination rates are falling. And the gap between public health messaging and parental concerns keeps growing.</p>

    <p>The typical response is more information: fact sheets, debunking articles, CDC statistics. But information alone doesn't change minds&mdash;especially when trust has eroded.</p>

    <h2>What we learned</h2>

    <p>I've been exploring how the <a href="/framework/">behavioral science framework</a> might apply to vaccine hesitancy, specifically for MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination.</p>

    <p>The core insight from this work: <strong>a chatbot isn't enough.</strong></p>

    <p>Damon Centola's research on complex contagion predicts exactly this. Behavior change requires multiple reinforcing interactions from trusted sources. A single AI conversation&mdash;no matter how sophisticated&mdash;can't provide that.</p>

    <h2>What's actually needed</h2>

    <p>A complete system would need to include:</p>

    <h3>Different interfaces for different stakeholders</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For parents:</strong> Conversational tools that meet them where they are&mdash;addressing their specific concerns, providing evidence in accessible language</li>
      <li><strong>For nurses:</strong> Dashboards showing which families are hesitant, suggested talking points, conversation tracking</li>
      <li><strong>For school administrators:</strong> Vaccination rate data by school, progress toward herd immunity targets, notification tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visible community data</h3>
    <p>Parents respond to what others in their community are doing. A visualization showing "87% of families at your child's school have vaccinated&mdash;here's what it would take to reach 95%" creates social proof and shared purpose.</p>

    <h3>Trusted messenger activation</h3>
    <p>The pediatric nurse who's known the family for years has more credibility than any chatbot. The system should equip these trusted messengers with the right tools and information&mdash;not replace them.</p>

    <h3>Multiple touchpoints over time</h3>
    <p>A single conversation rarely changes deeply held beliefs. The system needs to support ongoing engagement: follow-up messages, check-ins, new information as it becomes relevant.</p>

    <h2>The DAWN prototype</h2>

    <p>As part of this exploration, I built a conversational prototype called DAWN (Dynamic Advocacy for Wellness Network). It demonstrates one piece of the puzzle: an AI system that can engage with vaccine-hesitant parents in a thoughtful way.</p>

    <p>Key features of the prototype:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Concern identification:</strong> Categorizes parent concerns (autism fears, ingredient worries, natural immunity beliefs, etc.) and tailors responses accordingly</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptive personas:</strong> Adjusts tone and approach based on how the parent communicates&mdash;more analytical for data-driven parents, more empathetic for worried parents</li>
      <li><strong>Stage awareness:</strong> Recognizes where parents are in their decision process (pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action) and meets them there</li>
      <li><strong>Evidence integration:</strong> Draws on peer-reviewed research and trusted sources (CDC, WHO, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) to address specific concerns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But I want to be clear: <strong>the chatbot alone isn't the solution.</strong> It's a prototype of one component in what would need to be a much larger system.</p>

    <h2>The evidence base</h2>

    <p>The approach draws on research about what actually changes minds on vaccine hesitancy:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Motivational interviewing</strong> works better than argumentation</li>
      <li><strong>Trusted messengers</strong> matter more than information quality</li>
      <li><strong>Stories</strong> are often more persuasive than statistics</li>
      <li><strong>Addressing specific concerns</strong> beats general messaging</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple conversations</strong> over time beat single encounters</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The MMR vaccine is a particularly urgent case: measles is one of the most contagious diseases, requiring 95% vaccination for herd immunity. Current rates in many communities have fallen well below that threshold.</p>

    <h2>The hard problems</h2>

    <p>This work raises difficult questions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ethics of persuasion:</strong> Where's the line between helping people make informed decisions and manipulating them?</li>
      <li><strong>Trust recovery:</strong> What do you do when institutional trust has broken down?</li>
      <li><strong>Misinformation asymmetry:</strong> Debunking false claims often takes more effort than making them</li>
      <li><strong>Identity and community:</strong> For some, vaccine skepticism is tied to group identity&mdash;changing the behavior means risking social bonds</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These aren't solved problems. Any serious effort needs to grapple with them honestly.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Current status</h2>

    <p>This is exploratory work. The DAWN prototype demonstrates what's possible with conversational AI for this domain. The broader framework suggests what a complete system might look like.</p>

    <p>The next steps would involve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Partnerships with healthcare systems to understand nurse workflows</li>
      <li>School district collaboration for vaccination data integration</li>
      <li>Testing conversational approaches with real parents</li>
      <li>Measuring actual behavior change, not just conversation quality</li>
    </ul>
