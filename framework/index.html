    <h1>The Framework</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Seven approaches to lasting behavior change</p>

    <p>This framework integrates seven research-backed approaches to behavior change. Each addresses a different aspect of how people come to adopt new beliefs and behaviors. Together, they provide a more complete picture than any single approach alone.</p>

    <h2>The foundational insight: Complex Contagion</h2>

    <p>Damon Centola's research on social contagion provides the foundation. His key finding: <strong>behavior change spreads differently than information.</strong></p>

    <p>Information can spread through weak ties&mdash;a single exposure is often enough. But behavior change requires something more:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multiple exposures</strong> from different sources</li>
      <li><strong>Reinforcement</strong> through dense social networks</li>
      <li><strong>Trusted connections</strong> who model the new behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This means one-time interventions rarely work. A single chatbot conversation, a single fact-check, a single removed post&mdash;these don't create the conditions for lasting change. We need systems that provide multiple touchpoints within trusted networks.</p>

    <h2>The seven approaches</h2>

    <ul class="theory-list">
      <li>
        <div class="theory-name">1. Complex Contagion (Centola)</div>
        <div class="theory-desc">Behavior change requires multiple reinforcing exposures within dense networks. Design systems that provide repeated touchpoints through trusted connections, not just single interventions.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="theory-name">2. Contact Theory (Allport)</div>
        <div class="theory-desc">Prejudice diminishes through meaningful contact with out-group members under conditions of equal status, common goals, and institutional support. Create structured opportunities for positive interaction across divides.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="theory-name">3. Restorative Practices</div>
        <div class="theory-desc">Focus on repairing harm and rebuilding relationships rather than punishment. Use circles, restorative questions, and facilitated dialogue to create accountability while maintaining community connection.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="theory-name">4. Social-Emotional Learning (SEL)</div>
        <div class="theory-desc">Build underlying capacities: self-awareness, social awareness, relationship skills, responsible decision-making. Address the emotional and social dimensions of behavior, not just the cognitive.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="theory-name">5. Bystander Intervention</div>
        <div class="theory-desc">Activate bystanders to interrupt harmful behavior. Reduce diffusion of responsibility, provide clear scripts, and make intervention feel safe and socially supported.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="theory-name">6. Behavioral Design (Nudge)</div>
        <div class="theory-desc">BJ Fogg's behavior model: Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. Make the desired behavior easier, more obvious, and more socially visible. Reduce friction for positive actions.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="theory-name">7. Moral Development (Kohlberg)</div>
        <div class="theory-desc">People operate at different stages of moral reasoning. Meet people where they are. Some respond to consequences, others to social norms, others to principles. Tailor messages accordingly.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How they work together</h2>

    <p>These approaches aren't alternatives&mdash;they're complementary. Each addresses a different dimension of behavior change:</p>

    <table>

      <tr>
        <td>Moral Development</td>
        <td>How to frame messages for different audiences</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>A complete intervention might:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Identify trusted messengers in the person's network (Complex Contagion)</li>
      <li>Create opportunities for positive interaction with diverse perspectives (Contact Theory)</li>
      <li>When harm occurs, use restorative questions to promote reflection (Restorative)</li>
      <li>Build emotional regulation and perspective-taking skills (SEL)</li>
      <li>Empower bystanders to speak up constructively (Bystander)</li>
      <li>Make the desired behavior visible and easy (Nudge)</li>
      <li>Frame the message appropriately for the person's moral reasoning (Moral Development)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>What's novel here isn't any single component, but the integration&mdash;bringing together detection, intervention, trusted networks, multiple interfaces, and continuous learning into a coherent system.</p>
